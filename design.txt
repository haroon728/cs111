There are three arrays of linked lists, idle, timeshare, and interactive
What we want to do is add three more linked lists one for each and we'll call
each the lottery que. 
Pseudo code: 
   When there is a context switch 
      select a scheduler que
      if standard que is not empty
         run normal scheduler 
      if standard que is empty 
         run lottery scheduler 
	    pick a number from set of Random numbers = rand
	    r = rand%T
	    sum = 0
	    for each process in que
	    	sum+= process_tickets 
		if(sum>r) 
		   run process
   When process is added to que 
      calculate T
   When process is removed from que 
      calculate T 
   In infrequent scheduler 
      calculate set of Random numbers
